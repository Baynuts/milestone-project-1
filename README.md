## Description

Fictitious site for 'The Monkees' band from the 1960's made for first milestone project.
Created using Bootstrap for general layout and responsive features and then customised for aesthetics. Clear design with easy to follow navigation with retro design.
Validated fully using w3C validator for HTML and CSS.

## UX

The site has been designed for current fans of the 'The Monkees' it has been created using a retro / vintage design so that it is in keeping with the music style and style used on the previous album covers.
It has been kept clean and clear as the demographic audience is in the older age bracket. It has been designed to showcase their hit music and music videos and to advertise their event booking, I would have included a shopping cart to purchase their back albums but no additional javascript was permitted.
